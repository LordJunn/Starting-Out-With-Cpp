/* A mobile phone service provider has three different subscription packages for its
customers:

Package A: For $39.99 per month 450 minutes are provided. Additional minutes are
$0.45 per minute.
Package B: For $59.99 per month 900 minutes are provided. Additional minutes are
$0.40 per minute.
Package C: For $69.99 per month unlimited minutes provided.

Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. It should ask which package
the customer has purchased and how many minutes were used. It should then display
the total amount due.

Input Validation: Be sure the user only selects package A, B, or C. */
