Hello there. 

Anyways here's some useful resources:

[The book itself.](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/starting-out-with-c-from-control-structures-to-objects/P200000003320/9780137450626)

[Something to remove numbers from the start of the line.](https://remove-line-numbers.ruurtjan.com/)

[To add indentation should there be none.](https://formatter.org/)

[In case you're stuck and I have yet to solve it, or you would like to see an alternate version.](https://jesushilarioh.com/c-plus-plus-programming-challenge-solutions/)
