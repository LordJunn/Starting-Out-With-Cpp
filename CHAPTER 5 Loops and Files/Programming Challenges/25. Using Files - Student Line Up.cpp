/* Modify the Student Line Up program described in Programming Challenge 14 so that
it gets the names from a file. Names should be read in until there is no more data to
read. If you have downloaded this bookâ€™s source code from the companion Web site,
you will find a file named LineUp.txt in the Chapter 05 folder. You can use this file to
test the program. (The companion Web site is at www.pearsonhighered.com/gaddis .) */
