/* If you have downloaded this book’s source code from the companion Web site, you
will find the following files in this chapter’s folder:
• Teams.txt—This file contains a list of several Major League baseball teams in alpha-
betical order. Each team listed in the file has won the World Series at least once.
• WorldSeriesWinners.txt—This file contains a chronological list of the World Series’
winning teams from 1903 to 2012. (The first line in the file is the name of the team
that won in 1903, and the last line is the name of the team that won in 2012. Note
that the World Series was not played in 1904 or 1994.)
Write a program that displays the contents of the Teams.txt file on the screen and
prompts the user to enter the name of one of the teams. The program should then dis-
play the number of times that team has won the World Series in the time period from
1903 to 2012. */
